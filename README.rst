=============================
CharIoT Southbound Dispatcher
=============================

|epl|_

The southbound dispatcher, is responsible for capturing sensor data as it comes in from the PANTHORA gateway. This micro-service initially processes the incoming message, adds some metadata and persists the packageâ€™s content both in the local and the cloud storage. It also forwards the message to the IPSE engine. 

The metadata that the Southbound dispatcher adds to a package are:

* A unique identifier of the message in the context of the fog node;
* A timestamp

There is some more processing of the message depending on the topology of the network, like:

* Transformation of a raw sensor value to a format that is understandable by the engines
* Basic validation of the incoming values (datatype, range, etc.)

Features
--------

* Receive message from the gateway
* Store message to the local database instance
* Store message to the cloud database instance
* Forward message to the engine

Incoming messages
-----------------

We expect messages from PANTHORA gateway in a JSON document.

The following example is a message from the gateway, it contains values from sensor connected via wire on the gateway.

The **gateway_mac_address** has the following pattern **NMS_801F122F1114**, because if it has started by number causes issues on serialization.


.. code-block:: shell

    {
        "<gateway_mac_addres>": {
            "fixedIO": {
                "din01": 0,
                ...
                "din16": 0,
                "ain01": 2060,
                ...
                "ain08": 1417
            }
        }
    }

The next example is a message from authenticated smart sensor. The **connection_type** can be wifi or ble.

.. code-block:: shell

    {
        "<gateway_mac_address>": {
            "<connection_type>": {
                "<connection_type>StatusCode": 0,
                "<connection_type>StatusText": "<connection_type> online",
                "sensorData": {
                    "sensorName": "Sensor01",
                    "sensorStatusCode": 0,
                    "sensorStatusText": "Sensor online",
                    "sensorValues": [
                        {
                            "name": "Temperature",
                            "value": "18.2",
                            "unit": "Celsius"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "Humidity",
                            "value": "37",
                            "unit": "%"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "BatteryVoltage",
                            "value": "8.3",
                            "unit": "Volts"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }

The last example is a message from not authenticated sensor connected via WiFi.

.. code-block:: shell

    {
        "<gateway_mac_address>": {
            "<connection_type>": {
              "<connection_type>StatusCode": 0,
              "<connection_type>StatusText": "<connection_type> online",
              "sensorData": {
                "sensorName": "Sensor01",
                "sensorStatusCode": 2,
                "sensorStatusText": "Sensor without authentication"
              }
            }
        }
    }
    
The following table descibes the error codes.
    
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - sensorStatusCode
     - sensorStatusText
   * - 1
     - "Undetectable sensor"
   * - 2
     - "Sensor without authentication"


Sensor firmware update Message
------------------------------

The gateway send message to the Southbound Dispatcher to update the status of firmware upgrading, the following
message is an example of real message sent by PANTHORA.

.. code-block:: shell

    {
        "<gateway_mac_address>": {
            "ftpFwUpd": {
                "sensorName": "Sensor01", 	
                "ftpFwUpdEventCode": 0,
                "ftpFwUpdStatusText": " Firmware Rejected",
            }
        }
    }


The following table descibes the status values.
    
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - sensorStatusCode
     - sensorStatusText
   * - 0
     - "Firmware Rejected"
   * - 1
     - "Firmware Approved"
   * - 2
     - "Starting Firmware Upload"
   * - 3
     - "Firmware Upload completed successfully"
   * - 4
     - "Firmware Upload not completed"


Southbound Package
------------------

The message format sent by southbound dispatcher is the following:

.. code-block:: shell

    {
        "package_id": "<unique-guid>",
        "timestamp": "2019-03-05T12:08:26.888375",
        "value": {
            "<metric1_id>": <metric1_value>, 
            "<metric2_id>": <metric2_value>
        }, 
        "sensor_id": "<gateway_mac_address>"
    }

Local storage
-------------

Starting, with the configuration option **dispatcher.database** we choose the database where the sensor message are stored locally to the
**Fog Node**, at last with **dispatcher.table** we selecting the name of serie.


The following snippet is an example of logs stored at Local Storage (InfluxDB).

.. code-block:: shell
    
    {
        "results": [
            {
                "statement_id": 0,
                "series": [
                    {
                        "name": "message",
                        "columns": [
                            "time",
                            "Humitidy",
                            "Temperature",
                            "sensor_id"
                        ],
                        "values": [
                            [
                                "2019-04-15T12:31:06.517926912Z",
                                null,
                                19.689,
                                "device_52806c75c3fd_Sensor05"
                            ],
                            [
                                "2019-04-15T13:23:12.738425856Z",
                                null,
                                19.27,
                                "device_52806c75c3fd_Sensor05"
                            ]
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

On each observation we tag it with the sensor id origin id.

Alerts
------

When southbound dispatcher received message from non authenticated sensor, it will raise an alert for Fog Node Administrator. 
In the following snippet you see an example of an alert generate by it.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "time": "2019-04-04T15:01:31.711862016Z",
        "id": "df009643-8d0b-4ea3-aee5-6772e55ea8f5",
        "message": "Package from unauthenticated sensor 'device_52806c75c3fd_Sensor02'",
        "name": "unauthenticated_sensor",
        "sensor_id": "device_52806c75c3fd_Sensor02",
        "severity": 100
    }


Health Check
------------

In order to check if the southbound dispatcher is working you need to send a message to it and wait to answer back.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ mosquitto_pub -h <southbound_broker_hostname> -p 1883 -m \
    '{"id": "<unique-guid>", "destination": "test", "timestamp": "2019-04-04T13:12:42.531931"}' \
    -t dispatcher/_health

And you are waiting for response with the following command.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ mosquitto_sub -h <southbound_broker_hostname> -p 1883 -t 'test'

    {
        "id": "<unique-guid>", 
        "name": "southbound-dispatcher", 
        "status": {
            "code": 0, 
            "message": "running"
        }, 
        "received": "2019-04-04T13:13:11.883693", 
        "sended": "2019-04-04T13:12:42.531931"
    }
